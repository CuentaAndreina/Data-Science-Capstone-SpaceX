# Data-Science-Capstone-Space
Background 
One of the most successful companies in the field is SpaceX, some of its achievements include: sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite Internet constellation that provides satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions into space. One of the reasons SpaceX can do this is that rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million; other providers cost more than $165 million each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Space Y wants to compete with SpaceX, , information will be gathered on Space X to determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

Objectives:
Explore how orbits, flight numbers, launch sites are related to launch success or failure.
To know the best predictive model.

**Methodology**
- Data collection using SpaceX API REST and Web Scraping (wiki pages)
- Data wrangling filtering data, eliminating duplicate values, missing values, etc.
- Explore Data with analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques and SQL queries
- Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
- Build models to perform predictive analysis and find the best hyperparameter
